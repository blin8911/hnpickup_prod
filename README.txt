How about if you apply your new strengths to the 
real world data? There are a lot of challenging 
problems waiting to be solved by you. But let's 
start small first. The first step is to get your 
own data. 

Is there any website that you visit every day?
I'm sure it produces fresh content daily: 
new articles, new stats, new numbers. How about 
you start collecting them? If you have your own
data you can use for answering new interesting 
questions.

Does your favorite website have any trends? More
articles are published in summer than winter?
More people are willing to "like" the articles
in spring than in autumn. Is it possible to predict
which article will be more "liked" on Facebook?

If you get an answer you should display it for 
others to see. Do it so that it's pleasurable 
for the eye. Colorful time series or multidimensional 
scaling should do the trick. Describe your graph 
so the people not familiar with your project 
can understand it and enjoy it.

What? It seems a lot of work? Well, here is a source
code that deploys with one command on Google App 
Engine. You just need to focus on where to get 
the data (ETL), what to do with it (DM), and how
to display it (VISUALIZATION). The examples are ready 
for you to swap them with your own.

Little by little you will master how to add monetary
value to your data and sell it in your successful
startup.

## =============================
## == START
## =============================

Create an account and new app placeholder at:

http://appengine.google.com/

Please install Google App Engine SDK from:

http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

Getting started with Python web app development is here:

http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/

For lunching the app you can use this nice GUI:

http://code.google.com/p/google-appengine-mac-launcher/
http://code.google.com/p/google-appengine-wx-launcher/

It's also good to have Google Analytics account:

http://www.google.com/analytics/

You can also check webmaster tools to make sure your
website is properly indexed by Google:

https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools

If you want advertisements to pay your app engine bill, 
apply here:

https://www.google.com/adsense/

Don't apply before you build your website because you will
get rejected.

## =============================
## == INTRO
## =============================

This is example of a simple data mining application.
Here Hacker News aggregator is our source of data. 
The data mining objective is to figure out when is good time
to post an article or a story on Hacker News website so
other people will up-vote it and it will get to from 
the "newest" page to "news" page.

## =============================
## == MODEL
## =============================

This app can serve as a simple business model where 
you claim is that your DATA MINING application 
bring better EXPERIENCE, OUTCOME, and VALUE to 
existing products. How come? If you start adding new
knowledge to existing data you will see the
pattern: large data can be abstracted to a small 
chunk of information that is more valuable
than the large dataset. That's how you sell your 
service. Example? Every day you observe cars;
that's a lot of data, however, you notice that
around 8 am there are many more cars than at other
hours; this is your small chunk of information.
This small chunk will save you 30 min of stuck
in traffic: better experience, outcome and value.

## =============================
## == CODE
## =============================

Most data mining application will have very similar 
information flow:

1.ETL -> 2.DM -> 3.VISUALIZATION

Which means:

1.GET THE DATA -> 2.ADD VALUE -> 3.USE IT

That's why the code is organized into three sections:

1. ETL = Extract, Transform, Load (GET THE DATA)
2. DM = Data Mining (ENRICH THE DATA, ADD VALUE)
3. VISUALISATION = Data presentation in a format 
   that can support decision making process (USE IT, SHOW IT)

You can think of the code as a "Hello, World!" web data mining 
example. You shouldn't be surprised that most of the code went
into visualization. That's how you get your customers to buy-in. 
Data for visualization is obtained using JSON serialization.

## =============================
## == WARNING
## =============================

This app shows some raw data. For more complicated projects
it might not be good idea to show the raw data. Too much
data on the user interface will clog the decision making
process.

## =============================
## == HOPE
## =============================

The hope is that young start-ups can use this 
code to quickly organize their thoughts and prototype 
their idea. Google App Engine can run this app for free, 
giving opportunity to demonstrate a working version of 
their idea and bigger potential for investors.
